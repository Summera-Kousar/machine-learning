## Correlation
There must be cause and effect relationship, simultaneous changes in two variables
1. Positive correlation(same direction of both, income to expense)
2. Negative correlation (different direction of both, price to demand)

## Coefficient of Determination(R Square)
## R-squared
It measures the proportion of the variation in your dependent variable explained by all of your independent
variable in the model helps to explain variation in the dependent variable. In reality, some independent variables(predictors)
don't help to explain dependent (target) variables. In other words, some variables do not contribute in predicting target 
variables.

Mathematically, R-squared is calculated by dividing sum of squared of residuals(SSres) by total sum of squares(SStot) and
then subtract it from 1. In this case of SStot measures toal variation. SSreg measures explained variation and SSres measures 
unexplained variation.

As SSres + SSreg = SStot, R2 = Explained variation/Total Variation
